            Here you can import studentsâ€™ assignments so that they can use AI to
            intelligently query their work in the Radiant mobile app. Students can
            provide access to their AI interactivity history allowing you to
            understand the issues they are trying to understand more deeply.
            Interactive participation with your students and their AI forums can
            be enabled in this tab. You should encourage your students to use AI
            to query their work, and support them in developing the complexity
            of their questioning, all of which you can do from here.
